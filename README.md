# Crime-Profiler
This project utilizes advanced SQL techniques and geospatial analysis to evaluate crime data with respect to the local population in Greater Manchester, highlighting predominant crimes across multiple regions over a 2-year period 
The project involes designing and implementing a simple rporting system using SQL Server and QGIS as a presentation layer. Using procedures and views, summarised crime reports were created with local population data in Greater Manchester between Jan 2017 and Dec 2018.

Spatial Analysis with QGIS

QGIS was used to design a geospatial visualization of Vehicle crime in Greater Manchester and Anti-Social Crime in Salford. The respective Views were added as a layer using the MSSQL connection to connect to the database. OpenStreetMap and Google satellite Map were used as base layer to explore the data.
